It also shows how developers can participate in the evolution of all the components that makes real Firefox O and its open source community by developing and contributing new and improved functionality. 

Gaia, is the suite of HTML 5-based applications that provide the graphical user interface layer in Firefox OS. These apps are commonly referred to as the core system apps, and they make up the environment in which users interact with their device hardware via Firefox OS. Gaia helps deliver a smart phone experience that is engaging, intuitive, and empowering. All of the apps included in Gaia are built using open web technologies. These apps provide core functionality for mobile device users, such as phone and call history, email and messaging, call history and contacts, camera and media, and so on. Operators can customize out-of-the-box Gaia in order to tailor the user experience for their customers. Customization occurs through branding, bundling of applications, and customization of the Gaia environment and settings in the Firefox OS platform. Gaia is provided by Mozilla in conjunction with Operator-specified preferences.
